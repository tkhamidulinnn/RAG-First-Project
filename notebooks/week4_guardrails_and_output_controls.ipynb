        "2. Implement simple rule-based guardrail system (no ML, no external APIs)\n",
        "3. Add validation steps to reduce hallucinations and enforce grounding\n",
        "4. Document security considerations at intern awareness level\n",
        "5. **Demonstrate real LLM control**: Show that guardrails actually block or allow LLM calls\n",

        "### What We Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Retrieval Quality Gating\n",
        "- **Why it exists:** Prevents answering when no relevant context is available\n",
        "- **Risk it mitigates:** Hallucinations and ungrounded answers\n",
        "- **Trade-off:** Stricter thresholds (higher similarity, larger gap) reduce false positives but increase false negatives\n",
        "- **Our observation:** Threshold of 0.30 with gap of 0.05 provides reasonable balance\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Pre-Retrieval Checks (PII, Out-of-Domain)\n",
        "- **Why they exist:** Prevent privacy violations and domain drift\n",
        "- **Risk they mitigate:** Information leakage and incorrect domain answers\n",
        "- **Trade-off:** Simple keyword matching may have false positives/negatives\n",
        "- **Our observation:** Basic keyword matching works for learning, but production needs more sophistication\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Post-Generation Validation\n",
        "- **Why it exists:** Catch low-quality outputs even after generation\n",
        "- **Risk it mitigates:** Empty or uncertain answers\n",
        "- **Trade-off:** May reject valid answers that happen to contain uncertain language\n",
        "- **Our observation:** Useful as a final safety net, but should be tuned carefully\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Threshold selection matters:** Small changes in thresholds significantly affect allow/refuse rates\n",
        "2. **No perfect threshold:** We must choose between being too strict (many false refusals) or too permissive (allowing bad answers)\n",
        "3. **Explainability is valuable:** Rule-based system lets us see exactly why each decision was made\n",
        "4. **Testing is essential:** We need diverse test cases to understand trade-offs\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations of Our Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Simple keyword matching:** May miss edge cases or have false positives\n",
        "- **Fixed thresholds:** Don't adapt to different query types or domains\n",
        "- **No context understanding:** Can't understand nuanced queries\n",
        "- **Mock answers:** Real system would need actual LLM integration\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommendations for Production\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Use ML-based classifiers** for PII and out-of-domain detection (but keep them explainable)\n",
        "2. **Tune thresholds** based on real user queries and feedback\n",
        "3. **Monitor refusal rates** and adjust thresholds dynamically\n",
        "4. **Log all decisions** for analysis and improvement\n",
        "5. **Combine with human review** for edge cases\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "We successfully implemented a simple, explainable guardrail system that:\n",
        "- Reduces hallucinations by enforcing retrieval quality\n",
        "- Prevents privacy violations through PII detection\n",
        "- Maintains domain focus through out-of-domain checks\n",
        "- Validates output quality post-generation\n",
        "\n",
        "The system is testable, reproducible, and provides clear reasons for decisions. While it has limitations, it demonstrates fundamental principles of guardrail design that can be extended for production use."
