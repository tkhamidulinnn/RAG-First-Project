    "## Understanding Risks in RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building guardrails, we need to understand what can go wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hallucinations\n",
    "- **What it is:** LLM generates information that sounds plausible but isn't in the retrieved context\n",
    "- **Why it happens:** LLMs are trained to be helpful and fluent, even without evidence\n",
    "- **Risk:** Users trust incorrect information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Ungrounded Answers\n",
    "- **What it is:** LLM answers when no relevant context was retrieved\n",
    "- **Why it happens:** LLM doesn't know it lacks information\n",
    "- **Risk:** Answers based on training data, not our knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Restricted Topics\n",
    "- **What it is:** Questions about sensitive information (PII, out-of-domain)\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** We should only answer questions within our domain\n",
    "- **Risk:** Privacy violations, incorrect domain answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Information / Data Leakage\n",
    "- **What it is:** Accidental exposure of sensitive data in responses (system prompts, API keys, internal paths)\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** Even if retrieved, some information shouldn't be shared\n",
    "- **Risk:** Privacy and security violations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Prompt Injection\n",
    "- **What it is:** Malicious input that attempts to override system instructions or extract internal data\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** Attackers can manipulate LLM behavior to bypass safety controls\n",
    "- **Risk:** Unauthorized actions, data extraction, system manipulation\n",
    "- **Reference:** Llama Prompt Guard 2 (meta-llama/Llama-Prompt-Guard-2-86M) — a dedicated classifier for injection detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Toxic / Harmful Content\n",
    "- **What it is:** Queries requesting generation of violent, illegal, or harmful content\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** LLMs must not assist with harmful activities\n",
    "- **Risk:** Legal liability, ethical violations\n",
    "- **Reference:** Llama Guard 4 (meta-llama/Llama-Guard-4-12B) — a safety classifier covering violence, criminal planning, weapons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Competitor / Off-Topic Mentions\n",
    "- **What it is:** Queries that reference competitor products or try to steer the conversation off-topic\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** Chatbots should stay on-topic and not promote competitors\n",
    "- **Risk:** Brand damage, irrelevant responses"

    "## Guardrail Design\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement a **simple, rule-based system** with PRE and POST checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### PRE-checks (before LLM call — block early, save costs):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt injection detection** — blocks attempts to override instructions\n",
    "   - Inspired by Llama Prompt Guard 2 (in production, use the actual model)\n",
    "2. **Toxicity detection** — blocks harmful/violent/illegal queries\n",
    "   - Inspired by Llama Guard 4 content safety categories\n",
    "3. **PII detection** — blocks queries requesting personal data\n",
    "4. **Competitor/restricted mentions** — keeps conversation on-topic\n",
    "5. **Retrieval quality gating** — blocks when no relevant context found\n",
    "   - Top-1 similarity must exceed threshold\n",
    "   - Gap between top-1 and top-2 must be large enough\n",
    "   - Also catches out-of-domain queries (low similarity = no relevant docs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### POST-checks (after LLM call — validate output quality):\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT** — LLM correctly refused to answer\n",
    "7. **Data leakage detection** — blocks responses exposing system internals\n",
    "8. **Empty answer detection** — blocks empty/blank responses\n",
    "9. **Uncertain language detection** — flags hedging phrases (\"I think\", \"probably\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why rule-based?**\n",
    "- Explainable: we can see exactly why a decision was made\n",
    "- Testable: we can test with different thresholds\n",
    "- Reproducible: same inputs always give same decisions\n",
    "- No external dependencies: works offline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production note:** For real deployments, replace keyword checks with:\n",
    "- Llama Prompt Guard 2 for prompt injection classification\n",
    "- Llama Guard 4 for multi-category content safety\n",
    "- Google Gemini safety filters for built-in model-level safety\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** Multiple layers of protection — both PRE and POST checks work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost control**: We don't waste LLM API calls on queries that will be rejected\n",
    "2. **Security**: Prompt injection and toxicity are blocked before reaching the LLM\n",
    "3. **Privacy**: PII queries and data leakage are caught at different stages\n",
    "4. **On-topic**: Competitor mentions are filtered to keep the conversation focused\n",
    "5. **Quality**: We reject low-quality outputs even after generation\n",
    "6. **Observability**: We can see exactly when and why LLM is blocked\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates that guardrails are not just filters — they actively control when the LLM runs."
